# Weather-App
A dynamic weather application that provides real-time weather updates for any city. This project integrates with the OpenWeather API to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and local time. The app also adjusts its background based on whether it's day or night.

Features:
- Real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API
- Dynamic local time display for the searched city
- Automatic day and night mode with background changes
- Weather icons that match current conditions
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

Technologies Used:
- HTML – Structure and layout
- CSS – Styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript  – Fetching weather data, updating UI dynamically
- OpenWeatherMap API – Real-time weather data
- Made in CodeSandbox

How It Works:
1. Enter a city name in the search bar.
2. Get instant weather details, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
3. View the current local time of the city.
4. Background adjusts based on whether it's day or night.

Why I Built This: 
I created this project to improve my front-end development skills and work with real-world APIs. This app helped me strengthen my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, API handling, and responsive UI design.

Future Improvements:
- Add a five-day weather forecast
- Implement geolocation to detect the user’s city automatically
- Introduce animated weather effects like rain or snow
